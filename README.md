Cricket Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the Cricket Data Analytics Project, where we harness the power of Web Scraping, Python, Pandas, and Power BI to uncover valuable insights from cricket data.

🏏 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze cricket-related data, providing meaningful insights into player performance, team statistics, and match trends. By leveraging web scraping techniques, we collect real-time cricket data, process and clean it using Python and Pandas, and visualize it with Power BI for impactful storytelling.


🔧 Technologies Used
•	Web Scraping: Extracting data from cricket websites using tools like BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
•	Python: Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
•	Pandas: Efficient data manipulation and analysis.
•	Power BI: Crafting interactive dashboards and visualizations.


🌟 Key Features
•	Automated data collection from cricket websites.
•	Comprehensive data cleaning and preparation for analysis.
•	Interactive visualizations highlighting key metrics like player scores, team rankings, and historical match trends.
•	Actionable insights for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and fans.


📊 Visuals and Insights

Explore the Power BI dashboards that present cricket data in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. The dashboards enable users to dive deep into trends and statistics that shape the cricketing world.
