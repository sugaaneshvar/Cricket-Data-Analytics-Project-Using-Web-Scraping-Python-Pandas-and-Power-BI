Cricket Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the Cricket Data Analytics Project, where we utilize the power of Web Scraping, Python, Pandas, and Power BI to reveal valuable insights from cricket data.

???? Project Overview The purpose of this project is to scrape cricket data, giving useful insights into player performance, team statistics, and match trends. Through the use of web scraping, we gather live cricket data, clean and process it with Python and Pandas, and visualize it with Power BI for effective storytelling.

???? Technologies Utilized • Web Scraping: Scraping data from cricket websites with tools such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium. • Python: Cleaning, transforming, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). • Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis in an efficient manner. • Power BI: Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

???? Key Features • Automated web scraping of cricket websites. • Thorough data cleaning and preprocessing for analysis. • Interactive visualizations emphasizing important metrics such as player scores, team rankings, and past match trends. • Actionable insights for cricket fans, analysts, and enthusiasts.

???? Visuals and Insights

Discover the Power BI dashboards that showcase cricket data in a compelling and easy-to-consume manner. The dashboards allow users to drill deep into trends and statistics that govern the cricketing world. ???? How to Use
